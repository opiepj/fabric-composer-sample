# Composer Client Application

A sample application that interacts with a Hyperledger Fabric middleware server to handle transaction and asset management.

## Setup

Run the following (assuming working directory is in this folder)

1. `$ npm install`
2. `$ npm start`

This will run the angular application on a webpack server and a node express server that your application will integrate with.
